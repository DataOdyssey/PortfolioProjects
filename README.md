# Data Aanalyst Portfolio

## Introduction

Hello!

Welcome to my Portfolio. My name is Sandeep Hebsur and I am excited to have you here!

In this repository, you will come across several folders and sub-folders that contain projects that demonstrate the following, but not limited to the following skills: data gathering, data wrangling, data exploration, statistical analysis, data visualization, presentation skills, etc. A majority of my projects are done using the SQL and Python programming language in Jupyter Notebook. Some of the most used packages are Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib.nogramming language in Jupyter Notebook. Some of the most used packages are Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib.

In the following sections of this README, I will provide a short summary of my data journey and brief descriptions of the projects in each folder. Letâ€™s get started!

# About Me & My Data Journey














This repository is for the projects I've done on the iNeuron Full Stack Data Science Course.

The program prepares me for a career as a Data Analyst / Analytics professional by helping me learn:
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Data Wrangling
* Data Cleaning
* Practical Statistics (i.e applying inferential statistics and probability to real-world scenarios, like analyzing A/B tests.)
* SQL for Data Analysis
* Data visualization to draw meaningful conclusions

# Technical Skills utilized

* Python
* Data Analysis / Wrangling libraries ( Numpy, Pandas)
* Data Visualization libraries ( Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* Jupyter Notebooks
* MS SQL
* Advanced MS Excel
* Tableau Visualization

# Python Projects

### For the following Python Projects I selected a large real-world dataset from kaggle; Performed data preparation & cleaning using Pandas & Numpy; Performed exporatory analysis & visualization using Matplotlib & Seaborn; Ask & answer questions about the data in a Jupyter notebook; Summarized the inferences with a conclusion.

## Proj#1 - Cars Dataset Data Wrangling & Exploration
## Proj#2 - Twitter Data Wrangling
## Proj#3 - US Accidents Analysis 
## Proj#4 - Weather Dataset Analyis
## Proj#5 - tmdb Movies data exploration

# SQL Projects

### In the following SQL Projects I have perfromed some basic aggregation functions like counts, sums, minimums, maximums ; used statistical operations, joins, CTEs, views, subqueries & Temp tables ; Prepared data for visualization in Tableau

## Proj#1 - COVID Data Exploration
## Proj#2 - Indian Census
## Proj#3 - Musicstore Dataset
## Proj#4 - Nashville Housing

# Excel Projects

### In the following Excel projects I have transformed or clean up a raw set of data on Excel. This will include using features like the trim formula, data types, removing duplicates, and more. Then, looked into descriptive statistics using the data analysis feature on Excel which give the important numbers like the average, min, max, quartiles etc. Analyzed the data using pivot tables. Finally, created reports using conditional formatting, xlookups, sumifs and more.

## Proj#1 - Banknifty & Nifty Live Option Chain
